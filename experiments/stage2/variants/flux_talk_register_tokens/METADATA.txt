EXPERIMENT METADATA
===================

Experiment ID: flux_talk_register_tokens
Created By: Cursor (Composer)
Model: Composer (Cursor's AI coding assistant)
Date: February 7, 2026
Version: 1.0

DESCRIPTION
-----------
FluxTalk-style register tokens implementation for Stage 2 cross-modality alignment.
Uses nested dropout and contrastive learning on overlapping tokens.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
- 4 register tokens (3 overlapping + 1 complementary)
- Per-modality token processing
- Nested dropout with linear schedule
- Contrastive alignment loss
- Complementary token regularization
